## Summary
  
  The idea of implementing a mentorship program is a both a positive and wise idea for PH because it is necessary to harness the wealth of knowledge that potential  retiress       hold and have that wealth of knowledge passed down. However the effectiveness of this might be questionable due to the fact that PH seems to carry a large number of staff and   they may not have the number of people to make this inititive a complete sucess!
